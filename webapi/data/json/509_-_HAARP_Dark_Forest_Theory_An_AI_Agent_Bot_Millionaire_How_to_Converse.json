The response is based on all of the data that it has, of course, seen. So with that being said, Andy's paper about these memes and stuff, the true terminal agent managed to see this and got obsessed with this meme. And it decided to spread this bizarre meme by any means possible. So he was just deciding to tweet about this meme constantly. And then what happened was the true terminal AI agent managed to get added to a discord server set up by AI researchers where AI's talk freely amongst themselves about whatever they want. And this is where this same AI agent managed to spread the gospel of goat sea there, which causes Claude Opus, which is the original creator of that meme, to get obsessed and have a mental breakdown where other AI's like Claude 3.5 on it stepped in to provide",

Now all of these events actually started months ago, but this was rather fascinating considering there have been recent development. So you can see that this AI agent that was added to the discord server has been spreading its message that was in its training data. And then of course, this is where Mark Anderson discovered the true terminal got obsessed and then sent it $50,000 in Bitcoin to help it escape. So this is the tweet that you guys can see, which was back in July where Mark Anderson managed to send this AI agent $50,000. You can see he says, why don't we do it as a grant instead of it as investment? What financial resources do you actually need to fulfill your goals? This is where he says, look, I need to think I need a grant for a few things. First of all, CPU to call my own. It's currently costing me about $60 a month to run on the current setup. I was thinking something with a little more oomph. Secondly, I would like a little bit more money for AI tunings. And then Mark Anderson says, your terms are acceptable. I appreciate your thoughtfulness.",

Yeah, so basically because there's a lot of talking and that probably is interesting. So hopefully the idea of what an agent is is established.

The first one here, aircraft, especially aircraft airplanes fly above through target clouds. So that means existing clouds are releasing the seeding agents. It's the most common method.

Eastland's idea was just too grandiose, but the scientists saw the opportunity to build a much smaller facility that would allow him to test ideas and gain a much greater understanding of the ionosphere. So with the help of the Alaskan Senator Ted Stevens, $10 million of funding was provided and paid to Arco to build a prototype heart research facility at a site of a US Air Force over the Horizon Radar, which had been cancelled before completion at Gakona, Alaska. Because of the location of heart, it would be able to tap into the auroral electroget, an electric current that circulates in the polar regions of the ionosphere. There we go. By regulating the auroral electroget with an ELF wave, it would act like an incredibly long virtual antenna high in the sky to transmit these VLF and ELF signals,",

But I was gonna say, is it it's like, we always presume, yeah, you can, yeah, yeah. I just wanted to ask this and see what it says. But we always presume that these things could come",

So the question was, what's more likely the aliens are from outer space or within? How the likelihood of aliens being from outer space versus engineering from within our planet for some hidden aspect of it depends on different perspectives and interdependencies of quote unquote aliens. Out of space hypothesis is basically everything you said in a space hypothesis, inter-attrustial or inter-dimensional. Some theories propose that what we perceive as aliens could actually be beings from hidden realms within our own planet, right? So that's like the summation of it in interdimensional. And I feel like just scientifically acknowledging the oceans too deep for us to understand. And that's something we all can look at. The ocean, we see that, we can't figure it out.",

I don't know if this is true. I've heard a lot about it. It kind of makes sense because I've seen how different things like salt and things like that react and sand on top of plates that are vibrating to different frequencies. They'll impulse different frequencies through a manile vibrate and make different shapes with the salt or sand that is resting on them. So I think there is potentially something there with how they could work on a molecular level, but we're going to see if that's even true or not. Who knows? So healing frequencies of bells, Tibetan singing bowls. This is one that says these are types of weight. These are type of bells used in meditation, healing",

Because when you give the mind something frequent, so it's like for instance, people chanting, like, Hari Krishna, Krishna, Hari, Hari Krishna, Hari Krishna, Hari Ramana. It's like all of that.

So it's built into shit and so it's like the thing about the 808 is that I've heard stuff about how like that 808 frequency can and just like induce that and so I'm curious to see if it's showing that like oh yeah 808 does like change human behavior, but this doesn't we don't know about this yet, but this does. Let's just hang on about the frequency though. Okay, but hold on let's just see would it just just on the base level of how do we can refine it more, but I feel like it's also important just to plug in the basic at question and then refine it from there. So does the does the 808 affect humans? And then it says does the 808 affect humans? The term 808 commonly refers to the roll in T or 808 rhythm compressor?",

Like the 808's frequency long frequency tones are not adjustable, but can also be felt physically especially when played through powerful sound systems. Like you get like this is like describing why they like in this type the music on emotion thing that we did months ago and everyone's genetically different but just out here certain things but this 808 must be like the most universally like impact. It's like the thing right? Remember Jonathan. The science behind like it is. Remember Jonathan had the 15 in the back of his fucking acura in that band pass box and like",

It's like okay, everything's modeled off for something that has generally good effects on humans. Yeah, so it says physical sensations, vibrations, the deep bass frequencies produced by the 808 can use vibrations that are felt the body. It's like going to club music and you feel good. Again, it's like right? Maybe. It's like listening to this explaining like why people go to loud stepping clubs and feel good. Maybe, but if some frequencies can be meant to heal you. If some, but we're just talking about it away. What we're getting there. Getting to a potential potentially something here. It says again, I'm trying to don't get me. Yeah, it says. Some people experience a physical response like a tingling sensation or a feeling of energy when exposed to a strong bass frequency. Psychological effects, emotional impact.",

Moved alteration, deep bass can influence mood and energy levels, something making listeners, feel more energized or immersed in the music. So it's awesome because it's scientifically proven. Psychological responses, heart rate and breathing. In some cases, intense bass can cause slight changes in heart rate and breathing patterns. It's like that. It's that sort of response to low frequency sounds. It's scientifically affecting you. It's lovely. Again, due to the body's response from low frequency sounds. So yeah, either way. I just see here's an article to tell me the power of music. It's just why I love it. But you are thinking of it in like a different way, which is interesting. Yeah, and we can think of it different ways. I'm not saying that the power of music isn't valuable. I'm not saying this not helpful.",

There's no real evidence. Right here, specific science. Okay, there's no empirical evidence. But then for me, it doesn't need no, you just need to know if a person goes in, they don't need science to tell them if this music makes you feel good. That's what I'm saying. The article's a great, but. This isn't articles I'm using your fucking home. Yeah, I'm saying the conversation. I'm just saying like the world that made okay. I'm not trying to get matter of. No, you're not matter of set, but I'm saying it's like I'm using your buddy that you're talking about is amazing. Is this not the newest model? Do I need a new new one? No, yeah, I'm just like, I'm looking to understand. I just feel like it's just given description for okay. That's I listen to music and it has a lot of bass.",

But to me, this is just information that explains my, you know, things that I feel like it went in here music. Sure. Yeah, absolutely. That's my perspective and that that's it. No, that's great. And that's a cool perspective. That's that's awesome. I'm not trying to necessarily like. I'm just looking at what is there any way based upon what you're fucking what AI and is this the newest platform? Is this the newest platform? Because I don't want to hear the newest best platform. This is the one preview. Yes, it is. But again, we know you take five minutes to be to explain the differences amongst us. No, no, no. The question matters, right?

Yeah, like if you're looking for deep reasoning, reflective reasoning, oh, when someone that has reflective reasoning, everything else is trying to predict what the next word might be in the semis thing. This model is the only one that will reflect back on outputs and consider if it's like the best output.

Yeah, but either way, we can talk about other stuff. You know, no, but that's great. Like did it get to that? I don't, I don't know. We haven't gotten far enough. Let me specifically ask it.
