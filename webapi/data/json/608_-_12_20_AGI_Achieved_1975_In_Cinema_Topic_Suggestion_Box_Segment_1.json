But the takeaway is dealt with this part here. Yes. Something that I found kind of interesting, he said, we need to all update our intuitions about what AI is and what it can do. And certainly that seems true. We've broken through some gear here, some wall. Human benchmarks for testing these models, they're pretty much obsolete. Before most of our benchmarks look like this, you can get a score between let's say 0 and 100%, right? Humans were somewhere right here.

But the new 04 model that they released or whatever they're going to call it, yeah, that clacked they're not 42. In other words, it sort of exceeded the peak of biological intelligence and is now continuing into intelligence that's only possible with these digital, artificial neural nets.

Now, if you watch the opening announcement, basically they were saying how for a lot of these benchmarks they used a very aggressive test time compute.

So we give it the question and then it gets to thinking. And as it's thinking, as it's token to thoughts. So that was pretty much it.

Whatever you could make a million versions, but some version of it being correlated with AI, whether it's future, but there was a direct correlation between the UAP and AI and AGI. That's it.
