It is time to move on from such things as films and movies and go into perhaps some more cosmic existential plane of conversation. So with that, we'll segue to a little bit of the idea. And there was this pod, or I guess it's a podcast. He's got a channel. This guy is really fasting interviews.

But the, so the summary is kind of a pre-cognition is a fundamental aspect of reality. So the doctor, it's a wargo, Eric Wargo is the doctor. So he kind of argues against this common perception that pre-cognition is impossible or purely supernatural.

So the Dr. Wargoi suggests that information from the future, access through pre-cognitive experiences like dreams or intuitions subtly influences our present choices.

It's a classic example of free will within constraints. So edipists, you're seeking to escape. And this is funny because the edipist stuff made me think of the red string theory, Jeff, because this is, I mean, as far as just the story and what occurs, it's kind of, it's very similar. So that story seems like it was likely this, but evolved. So he seeks to escape a prophecy about killing his father and marrying his mother, fled his home, yet his attempt to avoid fate led him directly to it. So because basically, this is one of the situations where he leaves and ends up killing a stranger, who I guess was married to some lady.

Goes up 900% with a $500 million market cap. And then within an hour, the entire thing falls out. And then all the retail investors lose all their money. And then all the allegations start flying about insider trading. As it started happening, her team went into clean up mode and started putting out there that they are not selling their coins. But you can't hide things on the blockchain. And it started coming out that the team was dumping.

The other list you wanted me to be alive to see them. Well, we're talking about we've we've talked before about time travel. Oh, that's easy. Yes, we'll destroy it or or if you happen to know someone that was alive in this time you could pull from them as a resource. So you might have to talk to your parents and I've been avoiding it. You know, you know Bob loves this year in this year in movies. Bob goes on about it all the time. You could do 1975. 1975 Chevy pickup. So yeah, so that gets us to Rex of the week. Recommendation of the week my recommendation of the week is to go and watch before it comes out on Christmas go watch the original Naspirato. Have you watched it? Yeah, fuck yeah, I watch it. Don't put don't you don't do this. I'm just asking you. Yes, I've watched it. You want me to reenact it right here? I'd like you to do it. I'll do it. It was silent. Oh, I got a recommendation.",

It's them. Yeah, no, it's that's some fact. That's a fact. Yeah, no, it's a fact. Kind of speaks to taking care of yourself. Don't obviously you're gonna take care of the people you love. And if you don't, that's you should get on that. Yeah, yeah, but assuming that you actually are worried so much about the people, you have to dedicate some time to yourself and your own well-being and getting yourself a little gift. We don't. It's just like twin peaks. Every day, don't think about it. Don't know it is. Give yourself a little gift. And that's some of the best advice.
