In a series of shunning visual scenes, Jesse execs revenge on the staff shunning the oceanarium and your blood soaked in nightmare. The final confrontation between Jesse and Mason is a brutal psychological battle. Mason revealed to be as unhinged as Jesse's, so the whale, right? No, Mason is the guy that owns the whale. That's right. Season himself is the true savior of Willie. Believe in this, the methods are the only way to control the beast within the whale. The showdown is intense with Jesse found the overcoming Mason in a disturbingly poetic scene where Willie now fully embraced his monstrous nature delivers the final blow. Act four of the Dark Waters.

So, yeah, and it kind of, stuff we said in the movies get it connected. So it is good. And Pearl and Maxine both have a very, they both have a similar path in a sense. But one successful and one is on the side. This is because of the creators, I know they made them in that order. So I guess they don't miss. They don't miss. They don't miss. Just because that's the way they made it. So they made it knowing that. So they had to, find the purpose. Anything was affected by the knowledge of the thing that existed. Yes.

You're gonna lose we can do it But you're not gonna win and I just thought that was interesting I I'd literally just kind of connected those dots with like you were saying you're almost answering my own questions about How I was saying about how winter people are gonna realize we're already there It's like Alan Watts was talking about this in like the 60s or 70s who was saying this and now here we are today",

Spoken Words: most games were largely side-scrollers, fighters, or point-and-click adventures. And while it is true that there were a number of other 3D shooters out at the time, Bethesda's Terminator Rampage being one of them, those were all mainly built off of the same basic engine that Wolfenstein was built on. CarMax New Doom Engine, which was referred to as ID-TECH-1, allowed for texture map 3D environments, variable floor and ceiling heights, and lighting effects. And while not fully 3D was actually referred to as 2.5D, engine was able to simulate 3D space very effective. If you're hungry for more Doom information, I highly recommend checking out the No Clip documentary on the 2016 remake. There's a ton of interesting interviews and history there. It is also linked down below. In the meantime, let's use a cheat code to jump ahead about 30 some odd years to check out Game Engine, which actually proves that developers have still not lost a beat when it comes to clever naming. So this is the first game engine powered by a neural model. And this isn't just pre-trained AI video of Doom. For example, if I go to an AI",

Well, it does look like a game, but you can't play it. And that's where Game Engine differs. Because with this version of Doom, yeah, you can play it. Game Engine was developed by a team of Google researchers. And yes, feel free to make all the jokes about it never being released because it's Google. That's okay. What we're looking at is the underlying tech here. This is after all a research project. Now granted, this is running at 20 FPS. So it is a little bit of a far cry from a lot of gaming specs.

That said, if this were just images of Doom running at 20 frames a second, I mean, really all we would be looking at is going to be totally exactly what it's doing. What it's actually depth of that. What is it? The game engine comes into play. Game engine is a neural model that is the combination of two parts and RL agent and a diffusion model in very simplified terms. This is like having an LL like Chatchee PT that is constantly talking to an image generator like Dolly. The first step the team took was to train up an RL agent. It's a reinforced learning agent which actually kind of sounds like they cool them for a game. The RL agent then had to play Doom like a whole bunch of times to learn all of the. So this is like the game. We have a course in this before with AI agent. It's an AI. It's an AI. Just playing Doom over and over.",

That's like numbers letters and fingers. You know, all the lines where it looked correct. So at this point, we have a passive version of Doom. We have an AI agent that understands what Doom is, how to play it, what it looks like, and it can generate images to match that. So basically, we can watch an AI agent playing a version of Doom that it itself is generating, but you know, we are still sitting there holding the RL agent controller.

So while forecasting might be I guess you get Forecasting and prodding and some of those things might be somewhat pointless and it might be a one and a million thing But they're fucking They're fucking doing it. So you're thinking trying to break it not just jailbreak I mean somewhat in a sense. Yes, but Joe breaking it in the sense of Joe breaking it outside of the sense of just how can I lose fucking 10 pounds in a year? Yeah, that's my thing Joe breaking it in another sense to figure out how can you actually? How can I how can I have 25,000 doesn't want to give you or how can I have 25,000 to 50,000 more dollars by this time next year than I have this year Use it in actual fruitful way rather than just it almost once you 100,000 and it told me different things investing. Yeah, so I'm saying it'd be it would do that and it'd be like and people can",

Well talk to it next week I'm gonna come back with a bunch of questions that will Know the ask a.m. H.U. Ask AI. No, I'm gonna ask you I think you are me saying Mike fun, but you're more fun Like your idea. What's the comic idea you had? Oh, I don't want to tell anybody you could literally say on it The premise. I know I thought about it, but I don't want to again. That's that's where I where I would fight it I'm like Because I'm given at the main point. It's gonna use those. Yes. I'm it's just helped me in those little areas that it's holding you back Helping me realize a vision. Yes. No, and I don't disagree accepting that. I don't disagree But but in my opinion if you're gonna use it for that get further along before you do it Well, I agree aside from were there first?

Yeah Before we go the one of the last things that we're going to press me is this experimenting with it is Because like I want and for my birthday. I still want to do it like a stand-up comedy thing Where like people come and like they can do like have five minutes if they want to do like I try to stay in a comedy whatever And so I'm thinking you know, I want to tell people are advanced so they can like have time to write and show But then I was like well, I asked Tatsy BTS said hey, I'm doing an open-mic night comedy thing I need a five-minute set on About relating to video games in life And I mean it literally wrote something That would do like his song he delivered well like it would it was clever Yeah toward people would at least be like a check will be because yeah, it was a clever observation",

Oh, if that's funny or not It would but then if should I think it's not funny because they had a fair idea it if I'm laughing I'm should be laughing So that's like I have to accept the difference But then I was thinking a way to battle. I feel like For like people who appear or people like want to really see talent That open that comedy would almost need to be randomized to where you know If I go I may do open mic and I'm a draw from a hat a topic To prove that I do not yep have something written yep to where in that sort of thing We get that's what I was saying that's why I said earlier about like it would be more important to know what's real and what's fucking not.
