No tears involved in any of this solace. No, no. Maybe tears of joy, but they haven't come. You know, you think they're on their way. I think so. You can see them off in the distance. Yeah, they might be. Yeah, you know, like I can see, I can see guys. Not today, maybe not tomorrow, but I think I'm going to cry this week. There's a crying cloud on the horizon.

Cause you tend to romanticize shit and the way it would have actually been. And like you see it later and it's like you're already married, but okay, but the way it's done, it's, I know it's mid-smoving though, because it's in most, I don't know, it's spoiler, but it's like a lot of like stories to be like, oh they end up going back with some true past love or whatever, but like in reality, the more realistic tour they see each other, it's like a really meaningful interaction, but like they've already got their lives and they're committed to that track that they're on. Yeah, and it's almost like they're just really sad to experience that moment, but it's part of life and so they move on and, I don't know, it's really, oh yeah, it's cool, it sounds good, I'm definitely, I want to check it out. What did you say the name was that I got? Past lives. Past lives. Yeah, past lives. And where can you find that? Can it is that all?

My recommendation of the week would be, go in for like 30 minutes, if you don't have 30, do 20, but just go, just go sit, just either to the park, out back, out front, just do the best you can to just go sit there and just hang out for 20 minutes. No phone, no phone, and don't do the best you can to just not move. Don't sit there and pitch it and just hang out and just see what happens. Sit still in nature and just, and just if you have thoughts, have them, don't hang on to them, just have a thought. Let them, let them, beam, let them be like a bird, right? Don't let a bird build a nest on your head. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Lanes there, you sure? Yeah, so there was a, it was passing across a mirror.

You don't let it, they're building nest, it's like when people have a bad thought and they are so scared of it that they fixate on it and they become consumed with it, it's like no, that we're gonna have fleeting ideas and thoughts, imaginations, and you can do that with just good thoughts if you're just trying to clear the mind, just be like, okay, I had the thought, just like a, I had the thought. Yeah, well, when you catch yourself doing it, because a lot of times you'll, you'll start doing it, you don't realize you're doing it, and then you'll catch yourself and you'll be like, wait, you know, I could just not fucking think about it.

No, but yeah, what I'm gonna say is that it's like the next step from there is just letting, paying attention, letting yourself have a thought, whenever you're out, when you're going through your day to day life, the next step from there would be understanding, like whenever you have those emotions, let them be, don't try and fight them off, don't try and dig into it. Let it be, and then soon enough you'll realize that it's gone just as fast as it came. And that's, again, it takes practice. It does take practice, but that's where I was saying, and that's where I say you would start, is just sitting by yourself 20 to 30 minutes and just whatever you think of. A little pensive, meditative state. Yeah, yeah. And the hard thing to be for people is this not-stop-go mentality that Americans have is just actually back, I don't have time to set the 15 minutes. Exactly. Because they use, like, you do. Yeah. The day you have time for, you make time for what's important, you think of the day. And mental health is good. You do it constantly looking at your phone, where it was like, think of me, it was like, my foot was to spend four hours a day.
